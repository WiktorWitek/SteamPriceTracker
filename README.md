# SteamPriceTracker
An app that send an email if item price on steam is lower than your target

To make it work you have to pass steam url with item that you are looking for (for example https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/%E2%98%85%20Butterfly%20Knife%20%7C%20Crimson%20Web%20%28Field-Tested%29)
Next you set the maximum price in variable called TARGET
Then you set up an email to send message from with login and app password
And thats all
